  >Hello. This is Ander/Simon. Those are the two names I mostly go by, other people closer to me might call me Noah tho, please ask for permission to call me that way if you're new meeting me. I'm Mexican and I speak both Spanish and English, my goal right now is to learn Russian and German. Uh, I'm a little bit of everything, I guess. Some people might call me edgy other might call me woke, I don't know man just choose the one you like more. I'm mostly dry when we first meet, OR dry at times; Please understand this is something I can't control sometimes and it just happens, don't start assuming I'm upset/mad if I do without asking me first AND looking for actual hints that I might be.
